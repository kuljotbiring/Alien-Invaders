# ðŸ‘½ Alien Invasion
Alien invasion is a mimic of the iconic arcade game; Space Invaders.
This project was created to further facilitate and demonstrate working
knowledge of Python 3.x

## ðŸš€ Introduction
> You must save earth from an alien invasion! You are to pilot a
spaceship which can move left and right on the bottom of the screen
using the arrow keys. You must fire bullets using the spacebar key
to make contact with and destroy the alien ships which appear on screen.
The game begins with alien ships moving across the screen approaching your
ship. If all aliens ships are destroyed on the current screen a new fleet
of aliens appear which move faster than before. Should any alien ship hit
your spacecraft or touch the bottom of the screen (reach earth) a ship is
lost. You only have three ships to fend off the invasion. Will you save
earth from this alien invasion? Or does earth face impendending doom?!?!
